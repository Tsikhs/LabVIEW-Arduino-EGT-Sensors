In this project readings are taken from EGT sensors placed in the exhaust of a 4 cylinder engine and displayed live in LabVIEWthrough 
the serial port. With the GUI created in LabVIEW we can easily compare the temperature differences in the 4 cylinders and thus adjust 
the trims of each cylinder more correctly. It is also possible to log the values ​​of the sensors in an excel file to the selected path.
If the setted excel filename already exists, a new file is created in order to maintain the old log files.

PARTS:
1)Arduino UNO
2)MAX6675 x4
3)K-Type Thermocouple sensor x4
